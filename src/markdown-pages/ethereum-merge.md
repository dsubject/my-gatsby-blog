September 15, 2022, marks the day Web3.0 has been waiting for: Ethereum’s long-awaited software upgrade, also known as “the Merge,” will finally be released.

Previously known as Eth 2.0, the Merge is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain that is anticipated to have a significant impact on the blockchain’s network, scalability, and power consumption.

<h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>

Before getting into Proof of Work(POW) versus Proof of Stake(POS), we should talk about consensus mechanisms. Being a decentralized and often public digital ledger, there needs to be some way for blockchain networks to maintain security when it comes to transactions.

Consensus does just that: a consensus mechanism is a way to validate transactions in a blockchain network, thereby preventing fraud such as duplicate transactions. The consensus is made via peer-to-peer networks — aka nodes — that validate “blocks” of data before they can be added to the chain.

<h3>Proof of Work VS Proof of Stake</h3>

Proof of Work was the first consensus mechanism to exist. This is the method used by Bitcoin and up until tomorrow, Ethereum.

In a POW system, networked computers (aka miners) compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles with the goal of finding the correct string of values (known as a“hash”). The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded in cryptocurrency.

However, POW comes with its own set of problems.

1. <b>High operational costs.</b> Each transaction requires high amounts of computational resources, which creates a barrier to entry for those who can’t afford the equipment needed to solve the algorithms.

2. <b>Environmental impact.</b> There are roughly 1 million bitcoin miners currently in the world. Having thousands of machines racing to solve each individual transaction made on the bitcoin blockchain requires massive amounts of electricity.

3. <b>Scalability.</b> Because of the amount of energy it takes to process just one transaction, currencies using POW maintain a low transaction per second (TPS). For example, records (known as blocks) on the Bitcoin blockchain are limited in size and the frequency in which they can be processed, causing a bottleneck in Bitcoin’s capacity to process transactions.

<h3>Proof of Stake (POS)</h3>

Proof of stake is a consensus mechanism that requires participants to stake a portion of their cryptocurrency in order to become a “validator” (known as “miners” in a POW system). The two main differences between validators and miners are 1) validators have to stake money to participate, while miners have to invest in computational power, and 2) validators are randomly selected — similar to a lottery— while any miner can compete to validate a transaction.

The point of entry to becoming a validator on the ETH blockchain is said to start at 32 ETH, which is roughly 67 000 CAD at the time of writing this article. Validators are then chosen at random when a transaction is initiated. The more money a person stakes, the better their odds are to be picked. When a transaction is completed, those who contributed to the consensus process earn a transaction fee as payment.

POS consumes significantly less power than is required for POW. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is predicting a 99.9% reduction in power consumption after the merge is complete, which would nearly eliminate Ethereum’s carbon footprint. Additionally, due to requiring less computational power to validate transactions, proof of stake networks experience less latency, and transaction times are significantly reduced.

However, one of the major criticisms coming out about POS networks is the amount of money required to become a validator. By asking for large amounts of money upfront, those with the most money can in theory control the network, which negates the original goal of cryptocurrency to have a decentralized network. On the contrary, less power and a faster network mean validators are expected to eventually be able to access the network from phones and other small devices, unlike a proof of work network where miners need machines with high computational power to participate.

<h3>What's next…</h3>

Like anything in the crypto world, much of what is being written about the Merge is speculation. It’s impossible to know the exact outcome of the upgrade until it's complete. Regardless of what happens, the Ethereum merge is one of blockchain’s most exciting events to date and will more than likely play a significant role in defining the future of Web 3.0.
